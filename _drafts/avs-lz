Migrating applications from on-premise data centers to Azure comes up with unique challenges and lengthy timelines.
Azure VMware Solution offers a fastest way to migrate applications from on-premise VMware environments to Azure.
Because the migration uses VMware native tool - HCX - for performing migration, the whole process is similar to migrating applications from one vCenter to another vCenter.
While migration process is simple, once applications and VMs starts to run in Azure, they can invite multiple challenges.
These challenges are typically around following Critical Design Areas (CDAs).

1. Networking
2. Security, Governance and Compliance
3. Automation
4. BCDR
5. Management and Monitoring
6. Identity

Azure Landing Zone for Azure VMware Solution provides a prescriptive and best-practices backed guidance for each of the above CDA. Using this guidance, customers can migrate and manage applications and VMs running in Azure VMware Solution using standard operating process.

Each CDA includes key design considerations and design recommendations discussed in detail below.

1. Networking
2. Security, Governance and Compliance
3. Automation
4. BCDR
5. Management and Monitoring
6. Identity

This article provides a set of six videos that provides some additional context behind every design consideration and recommendation.
