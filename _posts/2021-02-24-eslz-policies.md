Azure Enterprise-scale Landing Zone (ESLZ for short!) is Microsoft's opinionated framework on how customers should use Azure. ESLZ is part of Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF). ESLZ is one of the recommended option in CAF "Ready" phase. With so many "Landing Zone" frameworks available, it can be complicated for customers to choose from multiple landing zone frameworks. One of the least discussed topic about ESLZ is it's focus on policy-driven governance. There are 90+ custom policies available in ESLZ which makes it easy to enforce compliance requirements ranging from preventing public IP addresses to automatically joining VMs to a Domain.
